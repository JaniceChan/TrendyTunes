# Planning Meeting #1

* Use Billboard and other social media websites to fluctuate prices at first, eventually it will fluctuate based on user activity 
  * Survey for users to see which social media they use for source of music

## Ideas
* In-app purchases
* Google Play Store / Apple Credit _(VERY HARD TO GET PARTNERSHIP)_
* Bias v.s. non-bias gathering data
* Warning for dropping songs/artists/albums when stock price reach minimum price (Price: TBA)

## Implmentation
* Testing needed before launch
* Test website to test fluctuations (Time-based/Condense Data for analytical purposes)
  * Bootstrap, no interface, java
* CANNOT play offline
* Timer for fluctuation refreshes -> Set time
